## Terms & Definitions

### Attributes

> Additional data values which may be returned along with variables.
> Each attribute maps to a specific member key within the parent key in the konf.

### Context

> Within the konf, you select data and objects from your source DOM. When the konf is evaluated, those selections are returned for use in a mobile template. A view context is a variable name/value mapping that is passed on to the template. [Learn more about context](https://support.mobify.com/customer/portal/articles/511697-template-reference)

### Keys

> Labels that uniquely reference each selection you make within the konf file. Also serve as variable/attribute names within your templates.

### Konf

> A JavaScript file that enables content selection from a source DOM.

### Rendered DOM

> The mobile site's post-adaptation DOM, the output of Mobify.js.

### Selections

> Data and objects returned by a jQuery-like (Zepto) selector within the konf file.

### Source DOM 

> Your site's original DOM, ie. the DOM tree you'd see if you viewed source before Mobifying.

### Templates

> A template is a text file that contains regular HTML markup, plus variables that are replaced when the template is rendered.

### Variables

> Context mapped data returned to your template from the konf selections. Each variable maps to a key in the context.
