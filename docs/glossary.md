# Mobify Glossary

* ATTRIBUTES - Additional data values which may be returned along with variables. Each attribute maps to a specific member key within the parent key in the konf.

* CONTEXT - A set of key-value pairs that is used to provide values for variables in templates. The Mobify.js konf produces a context, built from your selections, and renders a template with that context.

* KEY - A name that uniquely references a selection you make within the konf file, also serves as variable/attribute names within your templates.

* KONF - A JavaScript file that enables content selection and template rendering from a source DOM.

* RENDERED DOM - The mobile site's post-adaptation DOM, the output of Mobify.js.

* SELECTION - DOM elements or other data returned by functions defined in the konf file, provide the values of variables in templates to produce the rendered DOM.

* SOURCE DOM - The DOM built from your site's original HTML, without running javascript, ie. the DOM tree you'd see if you viewed source before Mobifying.

* TEMPLATE - A text file that contains regular HTML markup, plus variables that are replaced when the template is rendered.

* TEMPLATE VARIABLE - A placeholder name in templates that is replaced by the selection of the same name in the context when the template is rendered.
