## Terms & Definitions

### Attributes

> Additional data values which may be returned along with variables.
> Each attribute maps to a specific member key within the parent key in the konf.

### Context

> A set of key-value pairs that is used to provide values for variables in templates. The Mobify.js konf produces a context, built from your selections, and renders a template with that context. [Learn more about context](https://support.mobify.com/customer/portal/articles/511697-template-reference)

### Keys

> A name that uniquely references a selection you make within the konf file, also serves as a variable name within your templates.

### Konf

> A JavaScript file that enables content selection and template rendering from a source DOM.

### Rendered DOM

> The mobile site's post-adaptation DOM, the output of Mobify.js.

### Selections

> DOM elements or other data returned by functions defined in the konf file, provide the values of the variables in templates to produce the rendered DOM.

### Source DOM 

> The DOM built from your site's original HTML, without running javascript, ie. the DOM you'd see if you viewed source before Mobifying.

### Templates

> A text file that contains regular HTML markup and variables that are replaced when the template is rendered.

### Variables

> Context mapped data provided to your template from the konf selections. Each variable maps to a key in the context.
