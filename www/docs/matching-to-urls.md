# Matching Templates to URLs

Though you're encouraged to match tempaltes in Mobify.js by locating unique DOM 
elements, you can also match templates against URLs.

Mobify.js provides the `Mobify.urlmatch()` helper function to enable this. In 
your konf, you pass it a string containing a Mobify path matching pattern, or a
regular expression, and it will return a function to be used to check whether the URL of the page matches that pattern or expression. 

For example, in your konf, in a call to the choose function, you could cause the about template to be selected like so:

        {
            'templateName': 'about'
            , '!match': Mobify.urlmatch("/about/")
            , 'aboutus': function(context) {
                return $('#aboutus')
            }
        }

## Mobify.urlmatch() Path Expressions

Path expressions let you match templates to URL paths of pages on your site. 

### Placeholder Matching

For example, a blog article might have the path 
`/articles/2012/376562/15-ways-to-make-great-lists/`, but you could express the 
paths for all articles using the pattern `"/articles/*/*/*/"`, or only articles 
from 2012 with `"/articles/2012/*/*/"`. Here we see that `*` is used to mark a 
path component as a variable that is allowed to differ, but must be present.

If our URL structure were different, and we used a category as the first 
compoenent of the URL like `/science/articles/72633/` and 
`/politics/articles/95828`, but would like to match articles regardless of 
category, we could use the expression `"/*/articles/*/"` to match both of these.

### Wildcard Matching

Other times, we would like to match all URLs prefixed with a common path, to do 
this we use wildcard matching. For example, in a blog, a post without titles
would have a path such as `/post/29803152490` and a post with a title would have 
a path of `/post/29800908081/10-best-10-best-lists of all-time`.

We can match both of these with the expression `"/post/*"`. Note the lack of a trailing slash in comparison to the placeholder match: ending the expression 
with `*` will cause any path compoenents after the one specified to match.

## Matching with Regular Expressions

You can also use JavaScript's built in regular expressions to match the path.
