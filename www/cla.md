# Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in the Mobify.js ("Mobify.js") open source
project being administered by Mobify R&D Inc ("Mobify"). The form of
license below is a document that clarifies the terms under which You,
the person listed below, may contribute software, bug fixes,
configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials that you
send to us related to the Project (each a "Contribution") to the
project. We appreciate your participation in our project, and your
help in improving the project, so we want you to understand what will
be done with the Contributions. This license is for your protection as
well as the protection of Mobify and its licensees; it does not change
your rights to use your own Contributions for any other
purpose. Please read the following information about you and the
Contributions and complete the form that follows.

You and Mobify agree:

1. You grant us the ability to use the Contributions in any way.  You
hereby grant to Mobify, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide,
royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable license under all of Your
relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent,
and any other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of,
distribute and publicly perform and display the Contributions on any
licensing terms, including without limitation: (a) open source
licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL), the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL), the Common Public License, or the
Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD); and (b) binary,
proprietary, or commercial licenses.  Except for the licenses granted
herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the
Contribution.

2. You are able to grant us these rights.  You represent
that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that
You create, You represent that You have received permission
to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or
that Your employer has waived such rights for the
Contributions.

3. The Contributions are your original work.  You represent
that the Contributions are Your original works of
authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims,
or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or
patent related to the Contributions.  You also represent
that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into
an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with
the terms of this license.  For example, if you have signed
an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual
property rights in the Contributions to an employer or
customer, that would conflict with the terms of this
license.

4. We determine the code that is in our project.  You
understand that the decision to include the Contribution in
any project or source repository is entirely that of Mobify,
and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions
will be included in any product.

5. No Implied Warranties.  Mobify acknowledges that, except
as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution
is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT   LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
